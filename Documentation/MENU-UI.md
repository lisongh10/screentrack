# Menu User Interface

**Overview**\
This document describes the user interface for ScreenTrack's _Menu_.

Firstly, this is the ScreenTrack menu as of September, 6 2020.\

There are a few problems with the interface design. The standard and convention set by Apple shows that macOS menu interfaces should only have one column.

The following are Apple's designs for macOS menu interfaces.\

These are the problems that I wish to resolve with ScreenTrack's menu interface:

- 2 columns
- Out of date scroller
- Too many buttons on 1 row
- The menu interface and the main interface should **not** be similar in design

From Apple's standards I have created the following wireframe for ScreenTrack's Menu Interface.\

Here are the things I focused on when improving the user interface:
1. Navigation (There are now hover elements as well as hover effects)
2. Updated icons and symbols to current app development standards
3. Vertical placement instead of a horizontal table
